///
/// Startup ordering:
///
///   1. [initTorAtStartup] in `main.dart` runs before `runApp`. It
///      computes `<app_support>/tor`, calls [rust_sync.setTorDir] so
///      the Rust side knows where arti should keep its consensus
///      cache, reads the persisted toggle from secure storage, and
///      calls [rust_sync.setTorEnabled] with that value.
///
///   2. By the time any widget calls [build], the Rust `USE_TOR`
///      atomic already reflects the persisted state, so seeding
///      the notifier with `rust_sync.isTorEnabled()` is correct.
///
///   3. [TorSettingsNotifier.setEnabled] persists the new value to
///      secure storage, calls [rust_sync.setTorEnabled], updates the
///      notifier state for UI reactivity, and stops the current sync
///      so the next `open_lwd_channel` call picks up the new
///      transport. The running sync keeps its existing connection
///      until it's cancelled or finishes — the toggle only affects
///      future connections.

/// default `enabled = true` rather than letting it silently fall
/// back to `false`. A user who previously opted into Tor would
/// otherwise get their privacy downgraded to clearnet on any
/// transient read failure, and the first sync that followed would
/// auto-start over plain gRPC before the user had a chance to
/// notice.
///
/// Users who never opted into Tor take a one-launch bootstrap
/// penalty in the rare case where the read fails on a fresh install
/// — that's an acceptable cost for not silently leaking IPs to
/// lightwalletd operators.
///
/// If `getApplicationSupportDirectory` fails, we intentionally skip
/// the `setTorDir` call and still attempt to restore the toggle.

/// the "Tor enabled but TOR_DIR not set" error explicitly rather
/// than silently routing over clearnet.

  // set up successfully, default to `enabled = true` so a transient
  // secure-storage hiccup cannot silently downgrade an opted-in
  // user's privacy to clearnet.
  //
  // Fail-open rule: if the read throws AND dir setup ALSO failed,

  // "Tor enabled but TOR_DIR not set" — the wallet stays offline

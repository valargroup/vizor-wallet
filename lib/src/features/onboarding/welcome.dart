/// 215:2708 / 261:6662). The block does not reflow or rescale when
/// the user resizes the window: it stays at its native size and
/// the pane re-anchors it per-frame based on the pane height so
/// the UI column (Footer, Buttons, Title, Logo — all authored
/// bottom-up in Figma) keeps the exact pixel rows the spec calls
/// for.
///
/// Alignment is height-adaptive:
///   * pane height >= 552 dp → `Alignment.center`. The canvas fits
///     with symmetric `bg.ground` strips top and bottom, which
///     reads as intentional letterboxing when the user drags the
///     window taller than Figma's pane.
///   * pane height <  552 dp → `Alignment.bottomCenter`. The canvas
///     overflows the pane; bottom-anchoring keeps the UI CTAs
///     visible and lets the backdrop's soft top fade clip off,
///     which is far less load-bearing than the interactive footer.
///
/// Horizontal overflow always clips symmetrically (center
/// component of both alignments), and the rounded-rect clip on the
/// surrounding Container swallows the overflow evenly. Rationale:
/// the backdrop PNG is a three-layer Figma composition whose soft
/// fade edges were authored at this exact size, so stretching or
/// re-scaling the illustration breaks its alignment with the UI
/// column; keeping both in a single rigid canvas preserves the
/// Figma relationship as one unit and protects the CTA positions
/// that users interact with.
///
/// Two theme variants of the backdrop (261:6662 light / 303:1477 dark)
/// pre-compose the masked layering on the Figma side; the Dart side
/// just picks the right PNG per [AppTheme] without reproducing the
/// masking math.

# Clear app from iOS simulator (keychain + state + uninstall)
./clear-app.sh
```

### clear-app.sh

Removes the app from the booted iOS simulator including Keychain data. This is necessary when testing wallet creation/import because the mnemonic is stored in iOS Keychain via `flutter_secure_storage`, which persists even after a normal app uninstall.

## Architecture

Flutter + Rust FFI via `flutter_rust_bridge` v2. All Zcash cryptography and sync run in Rust (`librustzcash` crates). Dart handles UI, state management (Riverpod), and secure storage only. Supports iOS, Android, and macOS.

### Multi-Account Model

Single DB (`zcash_wallet.db`) holds multiple accounts from different seeds. Single sync loop decrypts notes for all accounts simultaneously via `scan_cached_blocks` (uses all UFVKs). UI shows one "active account" at a time.

**Account creation strategy** (due to `zcash_client_sqlite` constraints):
- **First account**: `create_account()` → `AccountSource::Derived`. Uses `init_wallet_db(seed)` so the seed is stored for future schema migrations.
- **Additional accounts (different seeds)**: `import_account_ufvk(AccountPurpose::Spending { derivation })` → `AccountSource::Imported`. Bypasses the single-seed fingerprint constraint in `create_account`.
- **DB init for additional accounts**: `init_wallet_db(None)` (no seed) to avoid `SeedNotRelevant` error when only Imported accounts exist.

**Account identification**: `AccountUuid` (UUID string like `"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"`). Passed as `String` between Dart and Rust via `Uuid::parse_str()` / `Uuid::to_string()`.

**Mnemonic storage**: Per-account in Flutter secure storage (`zcash_account_mnemonic_{uuid}`). Account list stored as JSON in `zcash_accounts` key. Active account in `zcash_active_account` key.

### Dart Provider Structure

```
AccountProvider (account_provider.dart)
  ├── Manages account list, active account, per-account mnemonics
  ├── createAccount() — first: create_wallet, additional: generateMnemonic + addAccount
  ├── importAccount() — first: import_wallet, additional: addAccount
  ├── switchAccount() — updates active, refreshes address
  └── getActiveMnemonic() — reads from secure storage

WalletProvider (wallet_provider.dart)
  ├── Watches AccountProvider
  ├── Exposes hasWallet, unifiedAddress, activeAccountUuid
  └── Propagates errors (does NOT mask as empty state)

SyncProvider (sync_provider.dart)
  ├── Passes activeAccountUuid to getBalance, getTransactionHistory
  ├── Sync itself is account-agnostic (covers all accounts)
  └── refreshAfterSend() called after account switch for immediate update
```

### Sync Engine (Rust-only)

The entire sync loop runs in Rust (`rust/src/wallet/sync_engine.rs`). A single call from Dart (`startFullSync()`) triggers the full pipeline:

1. tonic gRPC → lightwalletd (TLS via `tls-ring`)
2. Download subtree roots (sapling + orchard, incremental with start_index optimization)
3. Download compact blocks into memory (in-memory `MemoryBlockSource`, no file I/O)
4. `scan_cached_blocks` from memory (100 blocks per batch)
5. Enhancement: fetch full tx data (`GetStatus`, `Enhancement`, `TransactionsInvolvingAddress`)
6. Progress streamed to Dart via FRB `StreamSink` per batch

Single DB connection reused across entire sync (opened once, passed to all operations).

Progress percentage uses scan-queue block counting: after each batch, remaining unscanned blocks are calculated from `suggest_scan_ranges()` (excluding `Ignored`/`Scanned` priorities), then `pct = 1.0 - remaining / total`. This is accurate regardless of scan order (ChainTip-first, FoundNote, Historic). Each progress event includes `has_new_tx` (from `ScanSummary` received/spent note counts) to trigger transaction history refresh only when needed.

All sync log messages include `[Xs]` elapsed time from sync start. Errors are logged via `log` crate (forwarded to Flutter console by FRB `setup_default_user_utils()`). Log level set to `Info` to filter verbose rustls TLS logs.

### Two FFI Paths

```
Dart (foreground)                    Swift (iOS background)
    │                                    │
    ▼                                    ▼
api/sync.rs                          ffi.rs
start_full_sync(mode=1, sink)        zcash_run_full_sync() [C FFI, mode=2]
    │                                    │
    ▼                                    ▼
    └──── both call ────► sync_engine::run_sync_inner(running_mode, &DESIRED_MODE)
                              │
                              ▼
                    gRPC + scan + enhancement
                    (exits if DESIRED_MODE != running_mode)
```

- **Dart → Rust**: via `flutter_rust_bridge` (FRB). `start_full_sync()` returns `Stream<ApiSyncProgressEvent>`.
- **Swift → Rust**: via C FFI (`#[no_mangle] pub extern "C"`). `ffi.rs` exposes sync functions. Swift calls through `zcash_sync.h` imported in `Runner-Bridging-Header.h`.

`ffi.rs` is at `rust/src/ffi.rs` (NOT in `api/`) to prevent FRB codegen from generating Dart bindings for it.

### Sync Mode Management

Rust has a shared `DESIRED_SYNC_MODE` AtomicU8 (0=none, 1=foreground, 2=background).

- `run_sync_inner` checks `DESIRED_MODE != running_mode` after each batch → graceful exit
- Also checks after download and after scan (mid-batch) for faster response
- `SYNC_RUNNING` AtomicBool prevents concurrent sync (shared between FRB and C FFI)
- `SYNC_CANCEL` Arc<AtomicBool> unified — both `cancelFullSync()` (Dart) and `zcash_cancel_sync()` (Swift) set the same flag
- C FFI checks `DESIRED_MODE == 2` before starting (does not force-set mode)

### Foreground ↔ Background Sync Transitions

**Android**: Foreground service (`flutter_foreground_task`) adds notification only. Sync continues via same Dart FRB stream. No mode switching needed.

**iOS (26+)**: Mode switch triggers sync handoff.

Foreground → Background:
1. Dart: `setSyncMode(2)` → Rust fg sync exits at next batch
2. Dart: `bg_sync.startBackgroundSync()` → Swift BGTask submit
3. Swift handler (`using: nil`): dispatches to `.utility` syncQueue
4. Waits for `mode==2 && !is_running` (timeout 120s) → `zcash_run_full_sync()`
5. On completion with mode still 2: resubmits BGTask to continue

Background → Foreground:
1. Dart: `setSyncMode(1)` → Rust bg sync exits at next batch
2. Dart: waits for `isSyncRunning()==false` (timeout 120s) → `startSync()`

Expiration: `expirationHandler` cancels heartbeat + sets mode=0 + cancel → no resubmit → on app resume, detects mode=0 with backgroundMode=true → restarts foreground sync.

### iOS Background Sync

Uses `BGContinuedProcessingTask` (iOS 26+). Swift calls Rust directly via C FFI.

```
BGTaskScheduler.register(using: nil)  ← expirationHandler can run on different queue
    │
    ▼
handleBackgroundTask()
    ├── expirationHandler set (cancels heartbeat + sync)
    ├── syncQueue.async { runSync() }  ← .utility QoS, Rust inherits this
    └── semaphore.wait()               ← handler thread waits, doesn't block syncQueue

runSync():
    → wait for mode==2 && !is_running (timeout 120s)
    → heartbeat timer on .global(qos: .utility) — nudges completedUnitCount +1 every 5s
    → zcash_run_full_sync() [C FFI, blocking, current_thread tokio]
    → C callback: sets completedUnitCount = percentage * 10000 (scan-queue based)
    → C callback → SyncProgressStreamHandler → EventChannel → Dart (if foreground)
    → EventChannel forwards: scannedHeight, chainTipHeight, percentage, isSyncing, isComplete, hasNewTx
    → on completion: if mode still 2, resubmit BGTask
```

Key files:
- `ios/Runner/BackgroundSyncManager.swift` — `@available(iOS 26.0, *)`, BGTask handling with semaphore pattern
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` — task registration, MethodChannel + EventChannel, simulator check
- `ios/Runner/SyncProgressStreamHandler.swift` — bridges C callback → Dart EventChannel
- `ios/Runner/zcash_sync.h` — C header for all FFI functions

### iOS TX Tracking

Separate `BGContinuedProcessingTask` (`com.zcash.zcashWallet.txtrack`) polls lightwalletd `GetTransaction` every 5s to detect when pending transactions are mined or expired.

- `TxTrackManager.swift` — manages BGTask lifecycle, poll loop with `cancelled` flag
- `DynamicIslandManager.swift` — Live Activity lifecycle, priority switching (TX tracking > sync)
- Widget extension (`SyncWidget/`) — dual UI for sync progress and TX tracking states

### Send Flow

2-step: `propose_send(account_uuid)` → confirmation dialog (shows fee) → `execute_proposal()` → broadcast via `SendTransaction` gRPC.

- Integer-only ZEC-to-zatoshi parsing (no floating-point)
- Real fee estimation via `estimate_fee(account_uuid)` on each keystroke
- No-op Sapling provers for Orchard-only TXs (avoids 50MB param download)
- Post-send: `refreshAfterSend()` for immediate pending TX display
- Friendly error messages via `_friendlyError()` pattern matching

### Wallet Creation

`create_wallet()` fetches chain tip from lightwalletd as birthday height before creating the account. This prevents new wallets from doing a full chain scan. Birthday fetch failure blocks wallet creation (network required).

### Rust API Design Constraint

FRB codegen works best with simple types. Keep the `rust/src/api/` surface limited to primitives, `String`, and flat structs. Do all complex Zcash type manipulation inside `rust/src/wallet/` and return simple results through `rust/src/api/`.

All per-account API functions take `account_uuid: String`. Sync-level operations (`start_full_sync`, etc.) operate on all accounts and do NOT take account_uuid.

### Key Security Model

`zcash_client_sqlite` intentionally does NOT store spending keys in the DB — only viewing keys (UFVK). The mnemonic/seed lives in Flutter's `flutter_secure_storage` (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore) per-account (`zcash_account_mnemonic_{uuid}`) and is passed to Rust only when needed for transaction signing. Seed is scoped in a block and dropped before network I/O (broadcast).

### WalletDb Initialization

`WalletDb::for_path()` requires 4 params: `(path, Network, SystemClock, OsRng)`. `init_wallet_db()` must be called before `create_account()` — it runs schema migrations. First account uses `init_wallet_db(Some(seed))` for migration support; subsequent DB opens use `init_wallet_db(None)`.

### Dart Sync Provider

`lib/src/providers/sync_provider.dart` — Riverpod `AsyncNotifier`.

- `startSync()`: calls `rust_sync.startFullSync(mode:1)`, listens to FRB Stream via `.listen()`, fetches balance on each progress event. When `hasNewTx` or `isComplete`, fetches recent 10 transactions.
- `stopSync()`: calls `rust_sync.cancelFullSync()` (unified AtomicBool), immediately sets `isSyncing: false` in UI state
- `enableBackgroundSync()`: Android=notification only, iOS=`setSyncMode(2)` + BGTask submit
- `disableBackgroundSync()`: Android=notification remove, iOS=`setSyncMode(1)` + wait (120s timeout) + restart fg sync
- `isBackgroundSyncAvailable()`: Android=true, iOS=checks iOS 26+ via MethodChannel (false on simulator)
- `AppLifecycleListener.onResume`: refreshes balance + recent txs; if backgroundMode + syncMode==0 (expiration), restarts foreground sync
- iOS EventChannel listener for background sync progress with all fields (isSyncing, isComplete, hasNewTx)
- No polling — all state updates driven by stream events, EventChannel, and onResume
- `SyncState.recentTransactions`: latest 10 transactions, updated on `hasNewTx`, sync completion, and app resume
- All balance/history queries pass `activeAccountUuid` from `AccountProvider`
- `background_sync_service.dart`: platform abstraction (Android foreground service + iOS MethodChannel)

## Testing

- Rust unit tests: `cd rust && cargo test` (8 tests: key derivation, address encoding, determinism)
- Dart unit tests: `fvm flutter test`
- Integration tests: `fvm flutter test integration_test/` (requires device/simulator)
- Debug vs Release: Rust crypto is ~5-10x slower in debug (`opt-level=0`). Use `--release` for realistic sync performance.

## Crate Versions

Pinned in `rust/Cargo.toml`. Key crates: `zcash_client_backend` 0.21.2, `zcash_client_sqlite` 0.19.5, `orchard` 0.11, `sapling-crypto` 0.5. These must stay compatible — check librustzcash releases before bumping.

`tonic` 0.14 with `tls-ring` + `tls-webpki-roots` features for gRPC TLS. `rustls` 0.23+ requires explicit crypto provider — `tls-ring` provides this.

`log` 0.4 for Rust logging — forwarded to Flutter console via FRB. Level set to `Info` in `init_app()`.

Additional crates for multi-account: `uuid` 1.1, `zip32` 0.2, `jubjub` 0.10, `bls12_381` 0.8, `rand_core` 0.6.

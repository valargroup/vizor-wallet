# View Rust logs (log::info!, log::error!, etc.)
# FRB routes Rust logs to os_log (subsystem "frb_user"), not Flutter console.
# Run in a separate terminal:

```

### clear-app.sh

Removes the app from the booted iOS simulator including Keychain data. This is necessary when testing wallet creation/import because the mnemonic is stored in iOS Keychain via `flutter_secure_storage`, which persists even after a normal app uninstall.

### scripts/figma-export.js

Exports a single Figma node as a rendered, composited image (PNG / JPG / SVG / PDF) via the Figma REST API. Reach for this instead of the Figma MCP `use_figma` + `exportAsync` path whenever you need the bytes on disk as an asset. The MCP export route returns base64 through a 20 KB-truncated tool output, forcing a multi-call chunk reassembly; the REST endpoint renders server-side and returns a single signed URL, so one HTTP call produces the file.

```bash
node scripts/figma-export.js \
  --file <fileKey> --node <nodeId> \
  --output assets/illustrations/foo.png \
  [--scale 1|2|3]  # default 1
  [--format png|jpg|svg|pdf]  # default png
```

`fileKey` and `nodeId` come from the Figma URL — `figma.com/design/<fileKey>/<name>?node-id=<nodeId>`. The node-id in the URL uses a dash (`258-5229`); the script expects the canonical colon form (`258:5229`).

`FIGMA_TOKEN` (read scope is enough, Settings → Security → "Generate new token") must be set. Keep it in `~/.zshenv` rather than `~/.zshrc` — Claude Code's Bash tool spawns a non-interactive zsh which only sources `.zshenv` by default.

Output is minimal: start line, "downloading rendered image", and either `ok: <path> (<KB>)` or `fail: <msg>` with a non-zero exit.

## Architecture

Flutter + Rust FFI via `flutter_rust_bridge` v2. All Zcash cryptography and sync run in Rust (`librustzcash` crates). Dart handles UI, state management (Riverpod), and secure storage only. Supports iOS, Android, and macOS.

### Multi-Account Model

Single DB (`zcash_wallet.db`) holds multiple accounts from different seeds. Single sync loop decrypts notes for all accounts simultaneously via `scan_cached_blocks` (uses all UFVKs). UI shows one "active account" at a time.

**Account creation strategy** (due to `zcash_client_sqlite` constraints):
- **First account**: `create_account()` → `AccountSource::Derived`. Uses `init_wallet_db(Some(seed))` so the seed fingerprint is pinned to the DB and future seed-requiring migrations can verify relevance.
- **Additional accounts (even if derived from a known software mnemonic)**: `import_account_ufvk(AccountPurpose::Spending { derivation })` → `AccountSource::Imported`. We have to go through this path because `create_account` enforces a single-seed fingerprint per DB, so the second software account with a different mnemonic would be rejected. Derivation metadata (`Zip32Derivation { seed_fp, account_index }`) is attached to the `Imported` record so the account's origin is at least known, but librustzcash never stores the seed itself for imported accounts.
- **DB init after the first account**: remains `init_wallet_db(None)`. Calling `init_wallet_db(Some(other_seed))` after the first account would fail the seed relevance check if `other_seed` doesn't match the pinned `Derived` account.

**Multi-account migration limitation.** librustzcash `init_wallet_db` docs explicitly state:

> *"Note that currently only one seed can be provided; as such, wallets containing accounts derived from several different seeds are unsupported, and will result in an error."*
>
> *"We do not check whether the seed is relevant to any imported account, because that would require brute-forcing the ZIP 32 account index space. Consequentially, seed-requiring migrations cannot be applied to imported accounts."*

What this means for our DB shape:
- **First account** (`Derived`, known seed): future seed-requiring migrations run correctly for this account.
- **Every account after the first** (`Imported`, different seed fingerprint): the DB holds derivation metadata but not the seed, and librustzcash's migration machinery cannot distinguish "software account with a second seed we happen to know" from "external account imported from another wallet entirely." Both look like `AccountSource::Imported` with a non-matching fingerprint. The hardware (Keystone) case is a special instance of this general pattern, not a separate problem.
- What happens to 2nd+ accounts during a seed-requiring migration depends entirely on how the individual migration is written. Schema-only migrations (the common case) apply unchanged. UFVK-based re-derivation migrations also work. Migrations that strictly need the per-account seed for an `Imported` record either skip the step, run a best-effort fallback, or — in the worst case — refuse to complete.
- The correct mental model: **our wallet behaves as a multi-seed wallet inside librustzcash's officially-unsupported envelope**. Everything works today because current migrations tolerate `Imported` accounts. A future migration that doesn't is a real risk, and there is no clean in-library escape hatch because `create_account` cannot be called on a DB that already holds unrelated `Imported` accounts.

**Hardware-first wallet constraint** (Keystone). Enforcing the general rule above, the first account in any wallet **must** be a software (`Derived`) account. `importKeystoneAccount` in `lib/src/providers/account_provider.dart` rejects the call when `accounts.isEmpty`, and `import_hardware_account` in `rust/src/wallet/keys.rs` backstops the same invariant by scanning `AccountSource::Derived` before proceeding. This does not make the multi-account migration limitation go away — it only guarantees that:
- `init_wallet_db(Some(seed))` has at least one `Derived` account to verify against, so future seed-requiring migrations can at least *start* (an `Imported`-only DB would fail the relevance check with `SeedRelevance::NoDerivedAccounts` and refuse to open).
- The first account in every wallet is always fully covered by any seed-requiring migration.
- `create_account()` cannot rescue a DB that has already fallen into `Imported`-only state — that call itself needs seed-aware init, which re-fails the relevance check. Once you are in the bad state, you are stuck there. Forcing the first account to be `Derived` is the only way to prevent it at DB-creation time.

**Production tradeoff** (to revisit before release). Blocking hardware-first bootstrap gives the strongest migration guarantee but is hostile to Keystone-only users (they are forced to create or import a software mnemonic first). Alternatives considered: a hidden throwaway-mnemonic bootstrap (hacky, confuses the account list), or accepting the risk and documenting a re-import recovery flow when a future seed-requiring migration lands (simpler UX but requires users to re-scan from Keystone birthday when it happens). The current branch takes the conservative block. The actual production decision is deferred.

**Account identification**: `AccountUuid` (UUID string like `"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"`). Passed as `String` between Dart and Rust via `Uuid::parse_str()` / `Uuid::to_string()`.

**Mnemonic storage**: Per-account in Flutter secure storage (`zcash_account_mnemonic_{uuid}`). Account list stored as JSON in `zcash_accounts` key. Active account in `zcash_active_account` key.

### Dart Provider Structure

```
AccountProvider (account_provider.dart)
  ├── Manages account list, active account, per-account mnemonics
  ├── createAccount() — first: create_wallet, additional: generateMnemonic + addAccount
  ├── importAccount() — first: import_wallet, additional: addAccount
  ├── importKeystoneAccount() — hardware UFVK import, requires non-empty
  │                              account list (see Hardware-first constraint)
  ├── switchAccount() — updates active, refreshes address
  ├── renameAccount() — AccountInfo.copyWith (preserves isHardware)
  ├── getActiveMnemonic() — reads from secure storage (null for hardware accounts)
  └── isActiveAccountHardware — routes send flow to PCZT pipeline when true

WalletProvider (wallet_provider.dart)
  ├── Watches AccountProvider
  ├── Exposes hasWallet, unifiedAddress, activeAccountUuid
  └── Propagates errors (does NOT mask as empty state)

SyncProvider (sync_provider.dart)
  ├── Listens to AccountProvider (ref.listen, not watch) — auto-starts sync on account creation
  ├── startSync() is fire-and-forget with _syncGen generation counter
  ├── Polls getLatestBlockHeight every 10s after sync completes
  ├── Re-syncs automatically when new blocks detected or previous sync incomplete
  ├── Duplicate sync guard: _isSyncing (Dart) + isSyncRunning() (Rust)
  ├── Passes activeAccountUuid to getBalance, getTransactionHistory
  ├── Sync itself is account-agnostic (covers all accounts)
  ├── Delegates background sync to BackgroundSyncDelegate (Android/iOS/NoOp)
  ├── Polling pauses on app background (onHide), resumes on foreground (onResume)
  ├── Background sync completion detected on resume via delegate.onResume()
  └── refreshAfterSend() called after account switch for immediate update
```

### Sync Engine (Rust-only)

The entire sync loop runs in Rust (`rust/src/wallet/sync_engine.rs`). A single call from Dart (`startFullSync()`) triggers the full pipeline:

1. tonic gRPC → lightwalletd (TLS via `tls-ring`)
2. Download subtree roots (sapling + orchard, incremental with start_index optimization)
3. Download compact blocks into memory (in-memory `MemoryBlockSource`, no file I/O)
4. `scan_cached_blocks` from memory (100 blocks per batch)
5. Enhancement: fetch full tx data (`GetStatus`, `Enhancement`, `TransactionsInvolvingAddress`)
6. Progress streamed to Dart via FRB `StreamSink` per batch

Single DB connection reused across entire sync (opened once, passed to all operations).

Progress percentage: `initial_total` (total blocks to scan) is captured once before the scan loop from `suggest_scan_ranges()`. After each batch, `remaining` unscanned blocks are recalculated, then `pct = 1.0 - remaining / initial_total`. Note: `suggest_scan_ranges()` does not return `Scanned` ranges, so per-batch `total` cannot be used as the denominator. Each progress event includes `has_new_tx` (from `ScanSummary` received/spent note counts) to trigger transaction history refresh only when needed.

Automatic retry: `run_sync_inner` wraps `run_sync_impl` with exponential backoff (3 retries, 2s/4s/8s). Cancel and mode-change are checked during retry wait. Both FRB and C FFI paths benefit.

All sync log messages include `[Xs]` elapsed time from sync start (set once in `run_sync_inner`, consistent across retries). Errors are logged via `log` crate (forwarded to os_log subsystem `frb_user` by FRB `setup_default_user_utils()`). Log level set to `Info` to filter verbose rustls TLS logs. Rust logs are NOT visible in `flutter run` terminal — use `log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "frb_user"' --level info` in a separate terminal.

### Two FFI Paths

                    gRPC + scan + enhancement
                    (exits if DESIRED_MODE != running_mode)
```

- **Dart → Rust**: via `flutter_rust_bridge` (FRB). `start_full_sync()` returns `Stream<ApiSyncProgressEvent>`.
- **Swift → Rust**: via C FFI (`#[no_mangle] pub extern "C"`). `ffi.rs` exposes sync functions. Swift calls through `zcash_sync.h` imported in `Runner-Bridging-Header.h`.

`ffi.rs` is at `rust/src/ffi.rs` (NOT in `api/`) to prevent FRB codegen from generating Dart bindings for it.

### Sync Mode Management

Rust has a shared `DESIRED_SYNC_MODE` AtomicU8 (0=none, 1=foreground, 2=background).

- `run_sync_inner` checks `DESIRED_MODE != running_mode` after each batch → graceful exit
- Also checks after download and after scan (mid-batch) for faster response
- `SYNC_RUNNING` AtomicBool prevents concurrent sync (shared between FRB and C FFI)
- `SYNC_CANCEL` Arc<AtomicBool> unified — both `cancelFullSync()` (Dart) and `zcash_cancel_sync()` (Swift) set the same flag
- C FFI checks `DESIRED_MODE == 2` before starting (does not force-set mode)

### Foreground ↔ Background Sync Transitions

**Android**: Foreground service (`flutter_foreground_task`) adds notification only. Sync continues via same Dart FRB stream. No mode switching needed.

**iOS (26+)**: Mode switch triggers sync handoff.

Foreground → Background:
1. Dart: `setSyncMode(2)` → Rust fg sync exits at next batch
2. Dart: `bg_sync.startBackgroundSync()` → Swift BGTask submit
3. Swift handler (`using: nil`): dispatches to `.utility` syncQueue
4. Waits for `mode==2 && !is_running` (timeout 120s) → `zcash_run_full_sync()`
5. On completion with mode still 2: resubmits BGTask to continue

Background → Foreground:
1. Dart: `setSyncMode(1)` → Rust bg sync exits at next batch
2. Dart: waits for `isSyncRunning()==false` (timeout 120s) → `startSync()`

Expiration: `expirationHandler` cancels heartbeat + sets mode=0 + cancel → no resubmit → on app resume, detects mode=0 with backgroundMode=true → restarts foreground sync.

### iOS Background Sync

Uses `BGContinuedProcessingTask` (iOS 26+). Swift calls Rust directly via C FFI.

```
BGTaskScheduler.register(using: nil)  ← expirationHandler can run on different queue
    │
    ▼
handleBackgroundTask()
    ├── expirationHandler set (cancels heartbeat + sync)
    ├── syncQueue.async { runSync() }  ← .utility QoS, Rust inherits this
    └── semaphore.wait()               ← handler thread waits, doesn't block syncQueue

runSync():
    → wait for mode==2 && !is_running (timeout 120s)
    → heartbeat timer on .global(qos: .utility) — nudges completedUnitCount +1 every 5s
    → zcash_run_full_sync() [C FFI, blocking, current_thread tokio]
    → C callback: sets completedUnitCount = percentage * 10000 (scan-queue based)
    → C callback → SyncProgressStreamHandler → EventChannel → Dart (if foreground)
    → EventChannel forwards: scannedHeight, chainTipHeight, percentage, isSyncing, isComplete, hasNewTx
    → on completion: if mode still 2, resubmit BGTask
```

Key files:
- `ios/Runner/BackgroundSyncManager.swift` — `@available(iOS 26.0, *)`, BGTask handling with semaphore pattern
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` — task registration, MethodChannel + EventChannel, simulator check
- `ios/Runner/SyncProgressStreamHandler.swift` — bridges C callback → Dart EventChannel
- `ios/Runner/zcash_sync.h` — C header for all FFI functions

### iOS TX Tracking

Separate `BGContinuedProcessingTask` (`com.zcash.zcashWallet.txtrack`) polls lightwalletd `GetTransaction` every 5s to detect when pending transactions are mined or expired.

- `TxTrackManager.swift` — manages BGTask lifecycle, poll loop with `cancelled` flag
- `DynamicIslandManager.swift` — Live Activity lifecycle, priority switching (TX tracking > sync)
- Widget extension (`SyncWidget/`) — dual UI for sync progress and TX tracking states

### Send Flow

2-step: `propose_send(account_uuid)` → confirmation dialog (shows fee) → `execute_proposal()` → broadcast via `SendTransaction` gRPC.

- Integer-only ZEC-to-zatoshi parsing (no floating-point)
- Real fee estimation via `estimate_fee(account_uuid)` on each keystroke
- No-op Sapling provers for Orchard-only TXs (avoids 50MB param download)
- Post-send: `refreshAfterSend()` for immediate pending TX display
- Friendly error messages via `_friendlyError()` pattern matching

### Hardware Wallet (Keystone) Send Flow

Hardware send uses a **three-PCZT pipeline** that matches the
`zcash-android-wallet-sdk` / Zashi pattern. The hardware device cannot generate
ZK proofs (proving keys are too big for the device), and the phone cannot
sign (spending key lives on the device), so the two sides work on separate
clones of the same base PCZT and the phone combines them at the end.

```
1. createPcztFromProposal                      → base PCZT (phone)
   (IO-finalized, no proofs, no signatures)
      │
      ├── 2a. addProofsToPczt(base, params?)   → pcztWithProofs   (phone, CPU)
      │       (Orchard proof always; Sapling output proofs if the
      │        proposal has needsSaplingParams=true)
      │
      └── 2b. redactPcztForSigner(base)        → redactedPczt     (phone)
              → Keystone device (animated QR or USB EAPDU)
              → device signs Orchard spend_auth_sig
              → signed PCZT back to phone       → pcztWithSignatures
                                                       ↓
3. extractAndBroadcastPczt(
     pcztWithProofs, pcztWithSignatures,
     spend_params?, output_params?,
   )                                             → txid
```

Roles in the split:

| Step | PCZT role              | Runs on | Needs what                          |

**Critical invariants** (each of these was a real bug at some point in
development; breaking them is a correctness or data-loss regression):

1. **`extract_and_broadcast_pczt` must broadcast before it persists.**
   The function order is: `TransactionExtractor::extract()` (in-memory, no
   DB) → `send_transaction` gRPC → *only then* `extract_and_store_transaction_from_pczt`.
   Store-then-broadcast leaves the wallet in an unrecoverable state if
   lightwalletd rejects the tx: DB thinks the notes are spent, network
   has no record of the tx, user has to manually rescue the wallet.

2. **Local storage failure after a successful broadcast must not surface
   as a send failure.** The primary store path is
   `extract_and_store_transaction_from_pczt` (preserves rich PCZT
   recipient/memo metadata). On failure, fall back to
   `decrypt_and_store_transaction` — the same path sync uses when it
   discovers one of our sent txs on-chain. Correctness is preserved
   (spent notes get marked spent via nullifier matching) at the cost of
   some PCZT-only display metadata. Only if both paths fail do we
   return an error, and the error message must tell the user the tx is
   on the network and not to retry.

3. **Sapling params must be passed to BOTH `add_proofs_to_pczt` AND
   `extract_and_broadcast_pczt` whenever the PCZT contains a Sapling
   bundle.** `add_proofs_to_pczt` needs `LocalTxProver` to build Sapling
   output proofs; `extract_and_broadcast_pczt` needs `LocalTxProver
   ::verifying_keys()` (a) to validate the extracted transaction and
   (b) to let `extract_and_store_transaction_from_pczt` store it. Both
   functions share the `Option<&str>` / `Option<&str>` signature. If
   the caller supplied paths to `add_proofs_to_pczt` but passed `None`
   here, extraction bails with `SaplingRequired` and the user sees a
   cryptic error after already downloading 50MB of params and
   approving on the device. `send_screen.dart` threads the same
   `proposal.needsSaplingParams ? spendPath : null` into both FFI
   calls — keep it that way.

4. **`PROPOSAL_STORE` is consume-on-entry for both execute paths, plus
   explicit discard on cancel.**
   - `create_pczt_from_proposal` and `execute_proposal` both call
     `.remove()` at the top (dropping the store lock before any DB
     work). A second call with the same `proposal_id` returns
     `"Proposal not found (expired or already consumed)"`.
   - Dart `_send()` runs the whole flow inside a `try/finally`
     with a `proposalConsumed` flag that flips to true immediately
     after the consume call. The `finally` block calls
     `discardProposal(proposalId)` when the flag is still false —
     this covers confirmation-dialog cancel, Sapling-params-dialog
     cancel, exceptions during Sapling download, and any error
     before the consume call. `discardProposal` is idempotent.
   - If you add a new entry point that reads a stored proposal,
     follow the same "consume on entry, idempotent discard on any
     non-consuming exit" pattern. Silently reading without
     consuming (`.get()`) reintroduces the memory-leak /
     replayable-ID bugs that a prior revision of this branch had.

The Dart flow in `lib/src/features/send/screens/send_screen.dart`
implements this pipeline end-to-end; the Rust side lives in
`rust/src/wallet/sync.rs::{create_pczt_from_proposal,
add_proofs_to_pczt, redact_pczt_for_signer, extract_and_broadcast_pczt,
discard_proposal}` with FRB wrappers in `rust/src/api/sync.rs`.

### Wallet Creation

`create_wallet()` fetches chain tip from lightwalletd as birthday height before creating the account. This prevents new wallets from doing a full chain scan. Birthday fetch failure blocks wallet creation (network required).

### Rust API Design Constraint

FRB codegen works best with simple types. Keep the `rust/src/api/` surface limited to primitives, `String`, and flat structs. Do all complex Zcash type manipulation inside `rust/src/wallet/` and return simple results through `rust/src/api/`.

All per-account API functions take `account_uuid: String`. Sync-level operations (`start_full_sync`, etc.) operate on all accounts and do NOT take account_uuid.

### Key Security Model

`zcash_client_sqlite` intentionally does NOT store spending keys in the DB — only viewing keys (UFVK).

**Software accounts**: the mnemonic/seed lives in Flutter's `flutter_secure_storage` (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore) per-account (`zcash_account_mnemonic_{uuid}`) and is passed to Rust only when needed for transaction signing. Seed is scoped in a block and dropped before network I/O (broadcast).

**Hardware (Keystone) accounts**: no seed ever reaches the phone. On import the phone receives only the UFVK via QR/UR; the USK stays on the device. There is no corresponding `zcash_account_mnemonic_{uuid}` entry, and `getActiveMnemonic()` returns null for hardware accounts. Transaction signing happens inside the device via the PCZT handoff (see "Hardware Wallet (Keystone) Send Flow"), so the phone never holds spending key material for these accounts at any point.

### WalletDb Initialization

`WalletDb::for_path()` requires 4 params: `(path, Network, SystemClock, OsRng)`. `init_wallet_db()` must be called before `create_account()` — it runs schema migrations.

Seed-relevance rule:
- **First account (software)**: `init_db_and_create_account` calls `init_wallet_db(Some(seed))` then `create_account` → `AccountSource::Derived`. This pins the seed fingerprint so future seed-requiring migrations can verify relevance.
- **Subsequent opens**: `ensure_db_initialized` calls `init_wallet_db(None)`. Calling `init_wallet_db(Some(other_seed))` after the first account would fail the relevance check when any `Imported` account exists.
- **Hardware-first bootstrap is refused**: `import_hardware_account` returns an error if no `Derived` account exists yet. See "Multi-Account Model → Hardware-first wallet constraint" for the full rationale and the production tradeoff.

### Dart Sync Provider

`lib/src/providers/sync_provider.dart` — Riverpod `AsyncNotifier`.

**Auto-sync lifecycle:**
- `build()` watches `accountProvider` via `ref.listen` (not `ref.watch` — avoids rebuild on switch/rename)
- Account count increase triggers `startSync()` + `_startPolling()` (both first account and additional accounts)
- `_checkAndSync()`: polls `getLatestBlockHeight` every 10s, re-syncs if tip > last synced height or previous sync incomplete (`percentage < 1.0`)
- Polling stops during `_checkAndSync` execution to prevent concurrent overlap, restarts after
- Duplicate sync guard: `_isSyncing` (Dart-side bool) + `isSyncRunning()` (Rust AtomicBool)

**startSync() is fire-and-forget:**
- Sets up FRB stream listener and returns immediately (no Completer, no await)
- `_syncGen` generation counter: incremented by `stopSync()`, checked in `.then()` callbacks to invalidate pending operations after user-initiated stop
- Stream `onDone` → `_onSyncDone()` (balance refresh + start polling)
- Stream `onError` → sets error state + starts polling for auto-retry

**Sync control:**
- `stopSync()`: increments `_syncGen` + `cancelFullSync()` + `_stopPolling()`. Polling does not restart until next `onResume`
- `enableBackgroundSync()`: delegates to `BackgroundSyncDelegate`
- `disableBackgroundSync()`: delegates to `BackgroundSyncDelegate`. `disable()` returns `bool` — iOS returns `true` (needs fg restart), Android returns `false`

**BackgroundSyncDelegate** (`background_sync_delegate.dart`):
- Abstract interface with Android/iOS/NoOp implementations
- All `Platform.isAndroid`/`Platform.isIOS` checks isolated here (zero in sync_provider.dart)
- `shouldSuppressPolling`: Android=`false` (notification only), iOS=`_active` (BGTask manages sync)
- Android: `onSyncDone()` keeps `_active` true (notification persists across sync cycles)
- iOS: `onResume()` detects bg sync completion/expiration, `onProgress()` detects EventChannel completion

**Lifecycle:**
- `onResume`: refreshes balance → `_bgDelegate.onResume()` → `_checkAndSync()` (which starts polling)
- `onHide`: stops polling (no wasted network in background)
- `SyncState.recentTransactions`: latest 10 transactions, updated on `hasNewTx`, sync completion, and app resume
- All balance/history queries pass `activeAccountUuid` from `AccountProvider`
- `background_sync_service.dart`: platform abstraction (Android foreground service + iOS MethodChannel)

### Window Transparency (desktop acrylic)

Deps: `flutter_acrylic: ^1.1.4` plus a direct `macos_window_utils: ^1.9.1`. macos_window_utils is transitively in scope via flutter_acrylic but gets imported directly because the macOS path talks to `WindowManipulator.*` rather than flutter_acrylic's `Window.*` helpers (see below).

**Do not mix with `window_manager`'s `TitleBarStyle`.** flutter_acrylic expects to own the titlebar / background state; combining them corrupts colors. Let window_manager handle size / aspect ratio / minimum size, and flutter_acrylic + macos_window_utils handle titlebar transparency and material.

Initialization lives in `_configureTransparentWindow()` in `lib/main.dart`, guarded by `isDesktopLayoutPlatform`. Ordering matters:

```
WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()
→ RustLib.init()
→ initializeDesktopWindow()            [window_manager — creates + shows NSWindow]
→ [desktop] _configureTransparentWindow()        [acrylic setup]
→ [desktop] reapplyDesktopWindowConstraints()    [re-pin constraints after styleMask flip]
→ [desktop] windowManager.setSize(defaultSize)   [re-issue size after styleMask flip]
→ runApp()
```

Rationale for the order:

- `_configureTransparentWindow` can only affect an existing NSWindow. Running it before `initializeDesktopWindow` silently no-ops on cold start (and "magically works" only after a hot restart where the prior window survived).
- `enableFullSizeContentView()` flips the NSWindow `styleMask`. `window_manager`'s `setAspectRatio` writes to `contentAspectRatio` vs `aspectRatio` based on that bit at call time, so after the flip the aspect-ratio constraint needs to be re-applied. `reapplyDesktopWindowConstraints()` (see `lib/src/core/layout/app_layout.dart`) handles that — pure constraint refresh, never resizes the window.
- The same styleMask flip changes how `setSize` lands on macOS. Pre-flip, the visible titlebar carves ~32 pt of macOS titlebar height out of the requested frame, so a `setSize(900, 600)` inside `initializeDesktopWindow` leaves the Flutter content at 900×568. Post-flip the titlebar overlays the content, so re-issuing `setSize` at the call site (kept out of `reapplyDesktopWindowConstraints` so that helper stays safe to reuse from any future styleMask-changing path without snapping a user-resized window back to default) lands the requested dimensions on the pixels the user actually sees.

Per-platform recipe:

| Platform | Calls |
|---|---|
| **macOS** | `WindowManipulator.initialize()` → `setWindowBackgroundColorToClear()` → `makeTitlebarTransparent()` → `enableFullSizeContentView()` → `setMaterial(NSVisualEffectViewMaterial.fullScreenUI)` → `setNSVisualEffectViewState(NSVisualEffectViewState.active)` |
| **Windows** | `Window.initialize()` → `Window.setEffect(acrylic, color: Color(0xCC222222), dark: true)` |
| **Linux** | `Window.initialize()` → `Window.setEffect(transparent)` — acrylic not supported |

Why `WindowManipulator.*` on macOS but `Window.*` elsewhere: flutter_acrylic 1.1.4's macOS `Window.*` wrappers declare `Future<void>` but fire-and-forget the underlying `WindowManipulator` futures, so `await` on them is a lie — the method-channel call hasn't reached native by the time our next step runs. That race previously left `reapplyDesktopWindowConstraints` writing to the pre-flip `contentAspectRatio`, among other intermittent bugs. `WindowManipulator.*` actually awaits. On Windows / Linux flutter_acrylic's `Window.setEffect` goes through a different method-channel path that does await correctly, so those stay on the `Window.*` API.

**macOS specifics:**

- **NSWindow.delegate belongs to window_manager.** `AppLayoutNotifier` relies on window_manager's resize / fullscreen / maximize callbacks to auto-reconcile the large ↔ small layout. `macos_window_utils`'s `addNSWindowDelegate` (including flutter_acrylic's `NSWindowDelegate` hook) would clobber that by reassigning `NSWindow.delegate`, so **we must not register a macos_window_utils window delegate**. Use `NotificationCenter` observers in Swift instead (see fullscreen toggle below).
- **Blur view state** defaults to `followsWindowActiveState`, so the acrylic material desaturates whenever the window loses focus. Pin to `NSVisualEffectViewState.active` for a stable look (three options: `active` / `inactive` / `followsWindowActiveState`).
- **`TitlebarSafeArea` is required whenever `enableFullSizeContentView()` is called.** Wrap the app root inside `MaterialApp.builder`, under `AppTheme`; without it the macOS traffic-light controls overlap top-of-screen content.
- **Do not call `Window.hideWindowControls()`.** It appears in the flutter_acrylic example but strips min / max / close buttons, breaking the real app.

**macOS fullscreen blue-tint toggle.** The green-button fullscreen moves the window into its own Space, which has no wallpaper — just a neutral blue-gray backdrop. An acrylic material blurring that backdrop, combined with macOS wallpaper tinting, paints the whole window light blue. We drop the effect for the duration of fullscreen via:

- `macos/Runner/MainFlutterWindow.swift` registers a `NotificationCenter` observer (not the NSWindow.delegate) for `NSWindow.willEnterFullScreenNotification` / `willExitFullScreenNotification` and pushes `"willEnter"` / `"willExit"` strings into `FlutterEventChannel("app.zcash/fullscreen_events")`.
- `_installMacOSFullscreenEffectToggle()` in `lib/main.dart` subscribes to that channel: on `willEnter` it resets the NSWindow background to the opaque system default and swaps the material to `windowBackground`; on `willExit` it re-runs `_applyDesktopAcrylic()`. `willEnter` fires before the transition animation starts, so no blue-tint frame is visible.
- macOS-only. Windows / Linux fullscreen keeps the desktop wallpaper behind the window, so the acrylic blur stays visually valid — no toggle needed.

**Flutter-side transparency + design rule:**

- `Scaffold.backgroundColor: Colors.transparent` is required for the native effect to show through the Flutter render surface; the Scaffold-level setting overrides `MaterialApp.theme.scaffoldBackgroundColor`.
- Any opaque background (a widget `color`, a `ColoredBox`, a `Container.decoration` color) covers the native transparency in that region. **When designing a screen, keep any area that should reveal the window effect with no background color (or `Colors.transparent`), and only fill opaque backgrounds on regions that are meant to stay solid.** This means transparency is opt-in per-region on the Flutter side.

## Testing

- Rust unit tests: `cd rust && cargo test` — 11 tests covering key derivation, address encoding / Orchard-only UA derivation, determinism, and PROPOSAL_STORE lifecycle (idempotent discard, consume-on-entry, replay rejection). Tests that need a DB use `tempfile::tempdir()`.
- Dart unit tests: `fvm flutter test`
- Integration tests: `fvm flutter test integration_test/` (requires device/simulator)
- Zcash regtest Rust integration tests:
  - One-shot runner from repo root: `./run-regtest-rust-tests.sh`
  - The runner always starts by tearing down any existing regtest containers and resetting `.regtest/`, so each run starts from the same clean chain/wallet state.
  - Sapling proving params are cached separately at `~/.zcash-params` by default, so they survive `scripts/regtest/reset.sh`. Override with `SAPLING_PARAMS_DIR=/custom/path ./run-regtest-rust-tests.sh` if needed.
  - By default the runner also does a final `down/reset` cleanup after the tests finish. Use `./run-regtest-rust-tests.sh --keep` if you want to keep the regtest state around for debugging.
  - These regtest scenarios are slow and heavy. Do not run them unless the user explicitly asks for regtest/integration execution.
  - Manual flow:
    - Start services: `./scripts/regtest/up.sh`
    - Run individual scenario tests: `cd rust && cargo test --test regtest_receive_sync -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1`
    - Other available targets: `regtest_send`, `regtest_import`, `regtest_multi_account`
    - Stop services: `./scripts/regtest/down.sh`
  - The one-shot runner streams the full test output to the terminal and also saves a copy to `.regtest/regtest-rust-tests.log`.
- `scripts/regtest/` utilities:
  - `up.sh` — starts the Dockerized `zcashd + lightwalletd` regtest stack, waits for both services to become ready, and ensures the faucet state exists.
  - `down.sh` — stops the regtest Docker compose stack.
  - `reset.sh` — destroys the regtest containers/volumes and clears `.regtest/` state, then recreates a clean local chain on the next `up.sh`.
  - `mine.sh <count>` — mines `<count>` new regtest blocks through `zcash-cli`.
  - `fund-wallet.sh <unified_address> <amount_zec> [confirmations]` — sends shielded funds from the local faucet to the given UA, then mines enough blocks for confirmation. Example: `./scripts/regtest/fund-wallet.sh <ua> 1.25 10`
  - `lib.sh` — shared helper functions used by the other regtest scripts; source it from scripts, do not run it directly.
- Regtest prerequisites:
  - Docker Desktop / `docker compose` must be available.
  - `grpcurl` is optional but recommended. If installed, the scripts use it to wait for `lightwalletd` gRPC readiness and chain-tip propagation; otherwise they fall back to a simpler TCP port check.
- Debug vs Release: Rust crypto is ~5-10x slower in debug (`opt-level=0`). Use `--release` for realistic sync performance.

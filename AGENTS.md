## UI Copy Conventions

- **Sentence case is the project default for all user-facing strings**: button
  labels, nav items, tab titles, toasts, dialog titles/bodies, sidebar items,
  tooltips, error messages, status labels, form labels, picker headers, empty
  states, page titles. Only capitalize the first word and proper nouns. Keep
  proper-noun acronyms in their canonical form (`ZEC`, `USDC`, `USDT`, `NEAR`,
  `Vizor`, `Keystone`, `Zcash`, `Ethereum`).
- This applies to interpolated labels too: `'$symbol deposit tx'`, not
  `'$symbol Deposit tx'`. The asset symbol carries its own casing; the rest of
  the label is sentence case.
- Existing rationale and full audit are in `qa-copy-review.csv` and
  `copy-review-20260528-1554.csv` at the repo root. Reference these before
  introducing new copy in this project.
- When editing existing copy, also update widgetbook fixtures
  (`lib/widgetbook/*.dart`) and tests (`test/`) that assert on the literal
  string — `find.text(...)` matchers, `expectedNextAction` fields, and
  `_tooltipWithMessage(...)` helpers will break otherwise.

## Release Notes

When asked to prepare user-facing release notes or a changelog for a release,
read `release_notes/README.md` and create `release_notes/vX.Y.Z.md`.

### clear-app.sh

Removes the app from the booted iOS simulator including Keychain data. This is necessary when testing wallet creation/import because the mnemonic is stored in iOS Keychain via `flutter_secure_storage`, which persists even after a normal app uninstall.

### scripts/figma-export.js

Exports a single Figma node as a rendered, composited image (PNG / JPG / SVG / PDF) via the Figma REST API. Reach for this instead of the Figma MCP `use_figma` + `exportAsync` path whenever you need the bytes on disk as an asset. The MCP export route returns base64 through a 20 KB-truncated tool output, forcing a multi-call chunk reassembly; the REST endpoint renders server-side and returns a single signed URL, so one HTTP call produces the file.

```bash
node scripts/figma-export.js \
  --file <fileKey> --node <nodeId> \
  --output assets/illustrations/foo.png \
  [--scale 1|2|3]  # default 1
  [--format png|jpg|svg|pdf]  # default png
```

`fileKey` and `nodeId` come from the Figma URL — `figma.com/design/<fileKey>/<name>?node-id=<nodeId>`. The node-id in the URL uses a dash (`258-5229`); the script expects the canonical colon form (`258:5229`).

`FIGMA_TOKEN` (read scope is enough, Settings → Security → "Generate new token") must be set. Keep it in `~/.zshenv` rather than `~/.zshrc` — Claude Code's Bash tool spawns a non-interactive zsh which only sources `.zshenv` by default.

Output is minimal: start line, "downloading rendered image", and either `ok: <path> (<KB>)` or `fail: <msg>` with a non-zero exit.

## Architecture

Flutter + Rust FFI via `flutter_rust_bridge` v2. All Zcash cryptography and sync run in Rust (`librustzcash` crates). Dart handles UI, state management (Riverpod), and secure storage only. Supports iOS, Android, and macOS.

### Multi-Account Model

Single DB (`zcash_wallet.db`) holds multiple accounts from different seeds. Single sync loop decrypts notes for all accounts simultaneously via `scan_cached_blocks` (uses all UFVKs). UI shows one "active account" at a time.

**Account creation strategy** (due to `zcash_client_sqlite` constraints):
- **First account**: `create_account()` → `AccountSource::Derived`. Uses `init_wallet_db(Some(seed))` so the seed fingerprint is pinned to the DB and future seed-requiring migrations can verify relevance.
- **Additional accounts (even if derived from a known software mnemonic)**: `import_account_ufvk(AccountPurpose::Spending { derivation })` → `AccountSource::Imported`. We have to go through this path because `create_account` enforces a single-seed fingerprint per DB, so the second software account with a different mnemonic would be rejected. Derivation metadata (`Zip32Derivation { seed_fp, account_index }`) is attached to the `Imported` record so the account's origin is at least known, but librustzcash never stores the seed itself for imported accounts.
- **DB init after the first account**: remains `init_wallet_db(None)`. Calling `init_wallet_db(Some(other_seed))` after the first account would fail the seed relevance check if `other_seed` doesn't match the pinned `Derived` account.

**Multi-account migration limitation.** librustzcash `init_wallet_db` docs explicitly state:

> *"Note that currently only one seed can be provided; as such, wallets containing accounts derived from several different seeds are unsupported, and will result in an error."*
>
> *"We do not check whether the seed is relevant to any imported account, because that would require brute-forcing the ZIP 32 account index space. Consequentially, seed-requiring migrations cannot be applied to imported accounts."*

What this means for our DB shape:
- **Software bootstrap account** (`Derived`, known seed): future seed-requiring migrations run correctly for this account when the wallet was created through the software create/import path.
- **Imported accounts** (`Imported`, different seed fingerprint): the DB holds derivation metadata but not the seed, and librustzcash's migration machinery cannot distinguish "software account with a second seed we happen to know" from "external account imported from another wallet entirely." Both look like `AccountSource::Imported` with a non-matching fingerprint. The hardware (Keystone) case is a special instance of this general pattern, not a separate problem.
- What happens to 2nd+ accounts during a seed-requiring migration depends entirely on how the individual migration is written. Schema-only migrations (the common case) apply unchanged. UFVK-based re-derivation migrations also work. Migrations that strictly need the per-account seed for an `Imported` record either skip the step, run a best-effort fallback, or — in the worst case — refuse to complete.
- The correct mental model: **our wallet behaves as a multi-seed wallet inside librustzcash's officially-unsupported envelope**. Everything works today because current migrations tolerate `Imported` accounts. A future migration that doesn't is a real risk, and there is no clean in-library escape hatch because `create_account` cannot be called on a DB that already holds unrelated `Imported` accounts.

**Hardware-first wallet policy** (Keystone). Keystone accounts are allowed to be the first account. `importKeystoneAccount` in `lib/src/providers/account_provider.dart` routes a fresh install through password setup and then imports the hardware UFVK, and `import_hardware_account` in `rust/src/wallet/keys.rs` does not require an existing `Derived` account. This improves Keystone-only onboarding but accepts the known librustzcash tradeoff:
- A Keystone-first wallet can be `Imported`-only from DB creation time. Additional software accounts are also imported through UFVK metadata, so they do not automatically turn the wallet into a `Derived`-account DB.
- Current schema and UFVK-tolerant migrations should continue to work. A future seed-requiring migration that refuses `Imported`-only wallets may require a product recovery path, such as warning the user and re-importing/rescanning from the Keystone account birthday.
- Calling `create_account()` later is not a clean rescue mechanism for an `Imported`-only DB because that path itself depends on seed-aware initialization and seed relevance.

**Account deletion and reset invariants.** Per-account deletion is allowed for
`Imported` accounts and for a `Derived` account only if another `Derived`
account remains. Dart enforces this in `AccountNotifier.removeAccount`, and
Rust `delete_account` repeats the check inside the wallet DB write lock so the
invariant does not depend on a single UI caller. Deleting the last remaining
account is not a per-account delete; the Accounts UI treats it as a full wallet
reset, clearing the wallet DB, secure storage, active account state, and routing
back to onboarding.

**Account identification**: `AccountUuid` (UUID string like `"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"`). Passed as `String` between Dart and Rust via `Uuid::parse_str()` / `Uuid::to_string()`.

**Mnemonic storage**: Per-account in Flutter secure storage (`zcash_account_mnemonic_{uuid}`). Account list stored as JSON in `zcash_accounts` key. Active account in `zcash_active_account` key.

### Wallet Password Policy

- The local wallet setup/unlock password is **ASCII-only**. Accept only printable
  English letters, numbers, and symbols (`0x21`-`0x7E`).
- Do **not** implement keyboard-layout or IME normalization for passwords
  (for example, treating Korean 2-beolsik input as QWERTY). Passwords are
  compared as exact strings under this ASCII-only policy.
- Reuse the shared Dart helper in
  `lib/src/core/security/password_policy.dart` for all password validation.
- The charset validation message must stay exactly:
  `Use only English letters, numbers, and symbols.`

### Dart Provider Structure

```
AccountProvider (account_provider.dart)
  ├── Manages account list, active account, per-account mnemonics
  ├── createAccount() — first: create_wallet, additional: generateMnemonic + addAccount
  ├── importAccount() — first: import_wallet, additional: addAccount
  ├── importKeystoneAccount() — hardware UFVK import; may be first account
  │                              (Keystone-first accepts Imported-only DB risk)
  ├── switchAccount() — updates active, refreshes address
  ├── renameAccount() — AccountInfo.copyWith (preserves isHardware)

  ├── restoreAfterUnlock() — rehydrates active account UA from Rust after unlock
  ├── getActiveMnemonic() — reads from secure storage only while unlocked (null for hardware/locked)
  └── isActiveAccountHardware — routes send flow to PCZT pipeline when true

```

### App Bootstrap

`main()` does a one-shot bootstrap before `runApp()` and injects it via
`appBootstrapProvider`. This snapshot is the startup source of truth for the
first frame and avoids the old `/welcome -> /home` jump plus the "empty home
until sync callback arrives" flash.

- `loadAppBootstrap()` reads:
  - secure storage (`zcash_accounts`, `zcash_active_account`, `zcash_wallet_network`)
  - Rust wallet DB via `list_accounts`
  - active-account DB data via `get_sync_status`, `get_balance`,
    `get_transaction_history(limit: 10)`
- If the wallet is locked, bootstrap does **not** hydrate active address or
  initial balance/history; it routes straight to `/unlock` and lets the unlock
  flow repopulate that state.
- Router uses `bootstrap.initialLocation` instead of always starting at `/`.
- `AccountProvider` starts from `bootstrap.initialAccountState`.
- `WalletProvider` falls back to bootstrap values while `accountProvider` is
  still loading.
- `SyncProvider` starts from `bootstrap.initialSyncSnapshot` (balances, recent
  txs, scanned/tip heights) and then kicks off the normal live sync flow.
- Bootstrap is best-effort: route/account bootstrap can still succeed even if
  initial balance/history hydration fails, in which case sync state falls back
  to empty and the live sync repopulates it.

### Sync Engine (Rust-only)

The entire sync loop runs in Rust (`rust/src/wallet/sync_engine.rs`). A single call from Dart (`startFullSync()`) triggers the full pipeline:

1. tonic gRPC → lightwalletd (TLS via `tls-ring`)
2. Download subtree roots (sapling + orchard, incremental with start_index optimization)
3. Download compact blocks into memory (in-memory `MemoryBlockSource`, no file I/O)
4. `scan_cached_blocks` from memory (100 blocks per batch)
5. Enhancement: fetch full tx data (`GetStatus`, `Enhancement`, `TransactionsInvolvingAddress`)
6. Progress streamed to Dart via FRB `StreamSink` per batch

Single DB connection reused across entire sync (opened once, passed to all operations).

Progress percentage: `initial_total` (total blocks to scan) is captured once before the scan loop from `suggest_scan_ranges()`. After each batch, `remaining` unscanned blocks are recalculated, then `pct = 1.0 - remaining / initial_total`. Note: `suggest_scan_ranges()` does not return `Scanned` ranges, so per-batch `total` cannot be used as the denominator. Each progress event includes `has_new_tx` (from `ScanSummary` received/spent note counts) to trigger transaction history refresh only when needed.

Automatic retry: `run_sync_inner` wraps `run_sync_impl` with exponential backoff (3 retries, 2s/4s/8s). Cancel and mode-change are checked during retry wait. Both FRB and C FFI paths benefit.

All sync log messages include `[Xs]` elapsed time from sync start (set once in `run_sync_inner`, consistent across retries). Errors are logged via `log` crate (forwarded to os_log subsystem `frb_user` by FRB `setup_default_user_utils()`). Log level set to `Info` to filter verbose rustls TLS logs. Rust logs are NOT visible in `flutter run` terminal — use `log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "frb_user"' --level info` in a separate terminal.

```

- **Dart → Rust**: via `flutter_rust_bridge` (FRB). `start_full_sync()` returns `Stream<ApiSyncProgressEvent>`.
- **Swift → Rust**: via C FFI (`#[no_mangle] pub extern "C"`). `ffi.rs` exposes sync functions. Swift calls through `zcash_sync.h` imported in `Runner-Bridging-Header.h`.

`ffi.rs` is at `rust/src/ffi.rs` (NOT in `api/`) to prevent FRB codegen from generating Dart bindings for it.

### Sync Mode Management

Rust has a shared `DESIRED_SYNC_MODE` AtomicU8 (0=none, 1=foreground, 2=background).

- `run_sync_inner` checks `DESIRED_MODE != running_mode` after each batch → graceful exit
- Also checks after download and after scan (mid-batch) for faster response
- `SYNC_RUNNING` AtomicBool prevents concurrent sync (shared between FRB and C FFI)
- `SYNC_CANCEL` Arc<AtomicBool> unified — both `cancelFullSync()` (Dart) and `zcash_cancel_sync()` (Swift) set the same flag
- FRB also exposes `is_sync_cancel_requested()` so Dart can tell "still running"
  from "running but already cancelling"
- C FFI checks `DESIRED_MODE == 2` before starting (does not force-set mode)

### Foreground ↔ Background Sync Transitions

**Android**: Foreground service (`flutter_foreground_task`) adds notification only. Sync continues via same Dart FRB stream. No mode switching needed.

**iOS (26+)**: Mode switch triggers sync handoff.

Foreground → Background:
1. Dart: `setSyncMode(2)` → Rust fg sync exits at next batch
2. Dart: `bg_sync.startBackgroundSync()` → Swift BGTask submit
3. Swift handler (`using: nil`): dispatches to `.utility` syncQueue
4. `runSync()` bails out immediately if `mode != 2`; otherwise it waits only for
   any previous sync to finish, re-checking `mode == 2` while waiting
5. `zcash_run_full_sync()`
6. On completion with mode still 2: resubmits BGTask to continue

Background → Foreground:
1. Dart: `setSyncMode(1)` → Rust bg sync exits at next batch
2. Dart: `stopBackgroundSync()` cancels queued iOS BGTask requests so a late task
   launch cannot start one extra background sync after handoff
3. Dart: waits for `isSyncRunning()==false` (timeout 120s) → `startSync()`

Sign-out / Lock:
1. Dart: `securityNotifier.lock()` clears the session password and routes to `/unlock`
2. `AccountProvider.clearSensitiveStateForLock()` clears only in-memory address state
3. `SyncProvider.clearSensitiveStateForLock()` clears balance/history/progress,
   sends `setSyncMode(0)` + `cancelFullSync()`, then shuts background sync down
4. iOS `shutdownForLock()` cancels queued BGTask requests instead of requesting
   the normal foreground handoff (`mode=1`)
5. Unlock recovery runs `restoreAfterUnlock()` + `refreshAfterUnlock()` +
   `startSyncAnyway()` to recover from stale cancelled Rust work before
   re-entering `/home`

Expiration: `expirationHandler` cancels heartbeat + sets mode=0 + cancel → no resubmit → on app resume, detects mode=0 with backgroundMode=true → restarts foreground sync.

### iOS Background Sync

Uses `BGContinuedProcessingTask` (iOS 26+). Swift calls Rust directly via C FFI.

    └── semaphore.wait()               ← handler thread waits, doesn't block syncQueue

runSync():
    → if `mode != 2`, exit without work
    → wait for any previous sync to finish (timeout 120s), aborting if mode changes away from 2
    → re-check `mode == 2` after the wait loop before starting Rust
    → heartbeat timer on .global(qos: .utility) — nudges completedUnitCount +1 every 5s
    → zcash_run_full_sync() [C FFI, blocking, current_thread tokio]
    → C callback: sets completedUnitCount = percentage * 10000 (scan-queue based)
    → C callback → SyncProgressStreamHandler → EventChannel → Dart (if foreground)
    → EventChannel forwards: scannedHeight, chainTipHeight, percentage, isSyncing, isComplete, hasNewTx
    → on completion: if mode still 2, resubmit BGTask

`stopBackgroundSync()` on iOS now calls `BGTaskScheduler.shared.cancel(taskRequestWithIdentifier:)`
for the sync task identifier, so sign-out / foreground handoff cancels queued
work instead of only clearing Dart-side bookkeeping.
```

Key files:
- `ios/Runner/BackgroundSyncManager.swift` — `@available(iOS 26.0, *)`, BGTask handling with semaphore pattern
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` — task registration, MethodChannel + EventChannel, simulator check
- `ios/Runner/SyncProgressStreamHandler.swift` — bridges C callback → Dart EventChannel
- `ios/Runner/zcash_sync.h` — C header for all FFI functions

### iOS TX Tracking

Separate `BGContinuedProcessingTask` (`com.zcash.zcashWallet.txtrack`) polls lightwalletd `GetTransaction` every 5s to detect when pending transactions are mined or expired.

- `TxTrackManager.swift` — manages BGTask lifecycle, poll loop with `cancelled` flag
- `DynamicIslandManager.swift` — Live Activity lifecycle, priority switching (TX tracking > sync)
- Widget extension (`SyncWidget/`) — dual UI for sync progress and TX tracking states

### Send Flow

2-step: `propose_send(account_uuid)` → confirmation dialog (shows fee) → `execute_proposal()` → broadcast via `SendTransaction` gRPC.

- Integer-only ZEC-to-zatoshi parsing (no floating-point)
- Real fee estimation via `estimate_fee(account_uuid)` on each keystroke
- No-op Sapling provers for Orchard-only TXs (avoids 50MB param download)
- Post-send: `refreshAfterSend()` for immediate pending TX display
- Friendly error messages via `_friendlyError()` pattern matching

### Hardware Wallet (Keystone) Send Flow

Hardware send uses a **three-PCZT pipeline** that matches the
`zcash-android-wallet-sdk` / Zashi pattern. The hardware device cannot generate
ZK proofs (proving keys are too big for the device), and the phone cannot
sign (spending key lives on the device), so the two sides work on separate
clones of the same base PCZT and the phone combines them at the end.

```
1. createPcztFromProposal                      → base PCZT (phone)
   (IO-finalized, no proofs, no signatures)
      │
      ├── 2a. addProofsToPczt(base, params?)   → pcztWithProofs   (phone, CPU)
      │       (Orchard proof always; Sapling output proofs if the
      │        proposal has needsSaplingParams=true)
      │
      └── 2b. redactPcztForSigner(base)        → redactedPczt     (phone)
              → Keystone device (animated QR)
              → device signs Orchard spend_auth_sig
              → signed PCZT back to phone       → pcztWithSignatures
                                                       ↓
3. extractAndBroadcastPczt(
     pcztWithProofs, pcztWithSignatures,
     spend_params?, output_params?,
   )                                             → txid
```

Roles in the split:

| Step | PCZT role              | Runs on | Needs what                          |
|------|------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| 1    | Creator + IoFinalizer  | phone   | wallet DB                            |
| 2a   | Prover                 | phone   | proving params (Orchard always; Sapling ~50MB if target recipient is Sapling) |
| 2b   | Redactor               | phone   | —                                    |
| sign | Signer                 | device  | spend_auth_sig derivation (device holds USK) |
| 3    | Combiner + TransactionExtractor | phone | verifying keys (Orchard always; Sapling if bundle non-empty) + wallet DB |

**Critical invariants** (each of these was a real bug at some point in
development; breaking them is a correctness or data-loss regression):

1. **`extract_and_broadcast_pczt` must broadcast before it persists.**
   The function order is: `TransactionExtractor::extract()` (in-memory, no
   DB) → `send_transaction` gRPC → *only then* `extract_and_store_transaction_from_pczt`.
   Store-then-broadcast leaves the wallet in an unrecoverable state if
   lightwalletd rejects the tx: DB thinks the notes are spent, network
   has no record of the tx, user has to manually rescue the wallet.

2. **Local storage failure after a successful broadcast must not surface
   as a send failure.** The primary store path is
   `extract_and_store_transaction_from_pczt` (preserves rich PCZT
   recipient/memo metadata). On failure, fall back to
   `decrypt_and_store_transaction` — the same path sync uses when it
   discovers one of our sent txs on-chain. Correctness is preserved
   (spent notes get marked spent via nullifier matching) at the cost of
   some PCZT-only display metadata. Only if both paths fail do we
   return an error, and the error message must tell the user the tx is
   on the network and not to retry.

3. **Sapling params must be passed to BOTH `add_proofs_to_pczt` AND
   `extract_and_broadcast_pczt` whenever the PCZT contains a Sapling
   bundle.** `add_proofs_to_pczt` needs `LocalTxProver` to build Sapling
   output proofs; `extract_and_broadcast_pczt` needs `LocalTxProver
   ::verifying_keys()` (a) to validate the extracted transaction and
   (b) to let `extract_and_store_transaction_from_pczt` store it. Both
   functions share the `Option<&str>` / `Option<&str>` signature. If
   the caller supplied paths to `add_proofs_to_pczt` but passed `None`
   here, extraction bails with `SaplingRequired` and the user sees a
   cryptic error after already downloading 50MB of params and
   approving on the device. `send_screen.dart` threads the same
   `proposal.needsSaplingParams ? spendPath : null` into both FFI
   calls — keep it that way.

4. **`PROPOSAL_STORE` is consume-on-entry for both execute paths, plus
   explicit discard on cancel.**
   - `create_pczt_from_proposal` and `execute_proposal` both call
     `.remove()` at the top (dropping the store lock before any DB
     work). A second call with the same `proposal_id` returns
     `"Proposal not found (expired or already consumed)"`.
   - Dart `_send()` runs the whole flow inside a `try/finally`
     with a `proposalConsumed` flag that flips to true immediately
     after the consume call. The `finally` block calls
     `discardProposal(proposalId)` when the flag is still false —
     this covers confirmation-dialog cancel, Sapling-params-dialog
     cancel, exceptions during Sapling download, and any error
     before the consume call. `discardProposal` is idempotent.
   - If you add a new entry point that reads a stored proposal,
     follow the same "consume on entry, idempotent discard on any
     non-consuming exit" pattern. Silently reading without
     consuming (`.get()`) reintroduces the memory-leak /
     replayable-ID bugs that a prior revision of this branch had.

The Dart flow in `lib/src/features/send/screens/send_screen.dart`
implements this pipeline end-to-end; the Rust side lives in
`rust/src/wallet/sync.rs::{create_pczt_from_proposal,
add_proofs_to_pczt, redact_pczt_for_signer, extract_and_broadcast_pczt,
discard_proposal}` with FRB wrappers in `rust/src/api/sync.rs`.

### Wallet Creation

`create_wallet()` fetches chain tip from lightwalletd as birthday height before creating the account. This prevents new wallets from doing a full chain scan. Birthday fetch failure blocks wallet creation (network required).

### Rust API Design Constraint

FRB codegen works best with simple types. Keep the `rust/src/api/` surface limited to primitives, `String`, and flat structs. Do all complex Zcash type manipulation inside `rust/src/wallet/` and return simple results through `rust/src/api/`.

All per-account API functions take `account_uuid: String`. Sync-level operations (`start_full_sync`, etc.) operate on all accounts and do NOT take account_uuid.

### Key Security Model

`zcash_client_sqlite` intentionally does NOT store spending keys in the DB — only viewing keys (UFVK).

**Software accounts**: the mnemonic/seed lives in Flutter's `flutter_secure_storage` (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore) per-account (`zcash_account_mnemonic_{uuid}`) and is passed to Rust only when needed for transaction signing. Seed is scoped in a block and dropped before network I/O (broadcast).

**Hardware (Keystone) accounts**: no seed ever reaches the phone. On import the phone receives only the UFVK via QR/UR; the USK stays on the device. There is no corresponding `zcash_account_mnemonic_{uuid}` entry, and `getActiveMnemonic()` returns null for hardware accounts. Transaction signing happens inside the device via the PCZT handoff (see "Hardware Wallet (Keystone) Send Flow"), so the phone never holds spending key material for these accounts at any point.

### WalletDb Initialization

`WalletDb::for_path()` requires 4 params: `(path, Network, SystemClock, OsRng)`. `init_wallet_db()` must be called before `create_account()` — it runs schema migrations.

Seed-relevance rule:
- **Software bootstrap account**: `init_db_and_create_account` calls `init_wallet_db(Some(seed))` then `create_account` → `AccountSource::Derived`. This pins the seed fingerprint so future seed-requiring migrations can verify relevance.
- **Subsequent opens**: `ensure_db_initialized` calls `init_wallet_db(None)`. Calling `init_wallet_db(Some(other_seed))` after the first account would fail the relevance check when any `Imported` account exists.
- **Hardware-first bootstrap is allowed**: `import_hardware_account` initializes without a local seed and imports the Keystone UFVK. This can produce an `Imported`-only DB, so seed-requiring migration recovery must be handled at the product layer if such a migration appears.

### Dart Sync Provider

`lib/src/providers/sync_provider.dart` — Riverpod `AsyncNotifier`.

**Auto-sync lifecycle:**
- `build()` watches `accountProvider` via `ref.listen` (not `ref.watch` — avoids rebuild on switch/rename)
- Account count increase triggers `startSync()` + `_startPolling()` (both first account and additional accounts)
- `_checkAndSync()`: polls `getLatestBlockHeight` every 10s, re-syncs if tip > last synced height or previous sync incomplete (`percentage < 1.0`)
- `_checkAndSync()`, `_refreshBalance()`, and `_onSyncProgress()` all bail out while
  locked and discard late async completions via `_sensitiveStateEpoch`
- Polling stops during `_checkAndSync` execution to prevent concurrent overlap, restarts after
- Duplicate sync guard: `_isSyncing` (Dart-side bool) + `isSyncRunning()` (Rust AtomicBool)

**startSync() is fire-and-forget:**
- Sets up FRB stream listener and returns immediately (no Completer, no await)
- `_syncGen` generation counter: incremented by `stopSync()`, checked in `.then()` callbacks to invalidate pending operations after user-initiated stop
- Stream `onDone` → `_onSyncDone()` (balance refresh + start polling)
- Stream `onError` → sets error state + starts polling for auto-retry

**Sync control:**
- `stopSync()`: increments `_syncGen` + `cancelFullSync()` + `_stopPolling()`. Polling does not restart until next `onResume`
- `clearSensitiveStateForLock()`: increments `_syncGen`/`_sensitiveStateEpoch`,
  clears in-memory sync state, sends `setSyncMode(0)` + `cancelFullSync()`,
  tears down background sync, and waits briefly for stale Rust sync / mempool work to stop
- `startSyncAnyway()`: unlock recovery path. If Rust is still running but already
  cancelling, waits for teardown before starting foreground sync; if teardown
  times out, it at least restores polling so a later retry can recover
- `enableBackgroundSync()`: delegates to `BackgroundSyncDelegate`
- `disableBackgroundSync()`: delegates to `BackgroundSyncDelegate`. `disable()` returns `bool` — iOS returns `true` (needs fg restart), Android returns `false`

**BackgroundSyncDelegate** (`background_sync_delegate.dart`):
- Abstract interface with Android/iOS/NoOp implementations
- All `Platform.isAndroid`/`Platform.isIOS` checks isolated here (zero in sync_provider.dart)
- `shouldSuppressPolling`: Android=`false` (notification only), iOS=`_active` (BGTask manages sync)
- Android: `onSyncDone()` keeps `_active` true (notification persists across sync cycles)
- iOS: `onResume()` detects bg sync completion/expiration, `onProgress()` detects EventChannel completion

**Lifecycle:**
- `onResume`: refreshes balance → `_bgDelegate.onResume()` → `_checkAndSync()` (which starts polling)
- `onHide`: stops polling (no wasted network in background)
- `SyncState.recentTransactions`: latest 10 transactions, updated on `hasNewTx`, sync completion, and app resume
- All balance/history queries pass `activeAccountUuid` from `AccountProvider`
- `background_sync_service.dart`: platform abstraction (Android foreground service + iOS MethodChannel)

### Desktop Window Bootstrap

Desktop window appearance is managed by the external [`desktop_window_bootstrap`](https://github.com/chainapsis/desktop_window_bootstrap) package plus `window_manager`, with a strict responsibility split:

- `desktop_window_bootstrap` owns window appearance and titlebar overlap handling.
  - On macOS this means the transparent titlebar / full-size content-view shell is applied natively before the window is shown, via `macos/Runner/MainFlutterWindow.swift`.
  - The app calls `DesktopWindowBootstrap.initialize()` in `lib/main.dart` after `initializeDesktopWindow()` has created the OS window but before `showDesktopWindow()` reveals it.
  - `DesktopWindowTitlebarSafeArea` in `lib/app.dart` pads Flutter content below the macOS traffic-light/titlebar area. Keep it wrapped around the app root.
- `window_manager` owns sizing/lifecycle only.
  - `lib/src/core/layout/app_layout.dart` should remain responsible for initial size, minimum size, aspect ratio, `show()`, `focus()`, and layout-mode reconciliation from window events.
  - Do not reintroduce `TitleBarStyle` ownership or other appearance writes through `window_manager`; that overlaps with `desktop_window_bootstrap`.

Current startup order for desktop platforms:

```text
WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()
→ RustLib.init()
→ initializeDesktopWindow()      // window_manager creates the OS window
→ DesktopWindowBootstrap.initialize()
→ showDesktopWindow()
→ runApp()
```

Important desktop design rule:

- `Scaffold.backgroundColor: Colors.transparent` is required anywhere the native acrylic/translucent shell should remain visible.
- Any opaque `Container`, `ColoredBox`, decoration color, or other filled background will cover the native effect in that region.
- Treat transparency as opt-in per region: only paint solid backgrounds where the UI should actually be solid.

## Testing

- Rust unit tests: `cd rust && cargo test` — 11 tests covering key derivation, address encoding / Orchard-only UA derivation, determinism, and PROPOSAL_STORE lifecycle (idempotent discard, consume-on-entry, replay rejection). Tests that need a DB use `tempfile::tempdir()`.
- Dart unit tests: `fvm flutter test`
- Integration tests: `fvm flutter test integration_test/` (requires device/simulator)
- Flutter regtest E2E notes:
  - Run app tests with `--dart-define=ZCASH_DEFAULT_NETWORK=regtest`; do not use the old `ZCASH_USE_E2E_STORAGE` path. Secure storage and wallet DB names are network-scoped.
  - Cleanup code should guard on `kZcashDefaultNetworkName == ZcashNetwork.regtest.name`, then delete `getWalletDbName()` plus its `-shm` / `-wal` files.
  - Use `ZCASH_E2E_LIGHTWALLETD_URL` only as the endpoint override, and keep Rust API calls on the same network as `kZcashDefaultNetworkName`.
  - Mempool receive E2E should use external zcashd/lightwalletd funding when testing true inbound tx discovery, not another in-app account.
  - To prove mempool behavior while sync is active, pre-mine enough regtest blocks and pass the debug-only Rust throttle env vars inline: `ZCASH_E2E_SYNC_BATCH_SIZE` and `ZCASH_E2E_SYNC_BATCH_DELAY_MS`.
- Zcash regtest Rust integration tests:
  - One-shot runner from repo root: `./run-regtest-rust-tests.sh`
  - The runner always starts by tearing down any existing regtest containers and resetting `.regtest/`, so each run starts from the same clean chain/wallet state.
  - The runner writes its terminal log to `.regtest-logs/regtest-rust-tests.log`, which is intentionally separate from `.regtest/` so the log survives the default final cleanup.
  - Sapling proving params are cached separately at `~/.zcash-params` by default, so they survive `scripts/regtest/reset.sh`. Override with `SAPLING_PARAMS_DIR=/custom/path ./run-regtest-rust-tests.sh` if needed.
  - By default the runner also does a final `down/reset` cleanup after the tests finish. Use `./run-regtest-rust-tests.sh --keep` if you want to keep the regtest state around for debugging.
  - These regtest scenarios are slow and heavy. Do not run them unless the user explicitly asks for regtest/integration execution.
  - Manual flow:
    - Start services: `./scripts/regtest/up.sh`
    - Run individual scenario tests: `cd rust && cargo test --test regtest_receive_sync -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1`
    - Other available targets: `regtest_send`, `regtest_import`, `regtest_multi_account`
    - Stop services: `./scripts/regtest/down.sh`
  - The one-shot runner streams the full test output to the terminal and also saves a copy to `.regtest-logs/regtest-rust-tests.log`.
- `scripts/regtest/` utilities:
  - `up.sh` — starts the Dockerized `zcashd + lightwalletd` regtest stack, waits for both services to become ready, and ensures the faucet state exists.
  - `down.sh` — stops the regtest Docker compose stack.
  - `reset.sh` — destroys the regtest containers/volumes and clears `.regtest/` state, then recreates a clean local chain on the next `up.sh`.
  - `mine.sh <count>` — mines `<count>` new regtest blocks through `zcash-cli`.
  - `fund-wallet.sh <unified_address> <amount_zec> [confirmations]` — sends shielded funds from the local faucet to the given UA, then mines enough blocks for confirmation. Example: `./scripts/regtest/fund-wallet.sh <ua> 1.25 10`
  - `lib.sh` — shared helper functions used by the other regtest scripts; source it from scripts, do not run it directly.
- Regtest prerequisites:
  - Docker Desktop / `docker compose` must be available.
  - `grpcurl` is optional but recommended. If installed, the scripts use it to wait for `lightwalletd` gRPC readiness and chain-tip propagation; otherwise they fall back to a simpler TCP port check.
- Debug vs Release: Rust crypto is ~5-10x slower in debug (`opt-level=0`). Use `--release` for realistic sync performance.

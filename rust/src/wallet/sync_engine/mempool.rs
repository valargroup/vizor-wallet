//! Background observer for lightwalletd's `GetMempoolStream`.
//!
//! The block-scan loop in `sync_engine::mod` catches wallet-related
//! transactions at the granularity of a block batch — fast enough
//! for most flows, but always *after* the tx has been mined. This
//! observer closes that gap for outbound sends: as soon as
//! lightwalletd relays the wallet's own transaction back through
//! its mempool stream, we emit a `MempoolTxEvent { matched: true }`
//! and the Dart side refreshes balance + history without waiting
//! for the next block.
//!
//! Design choices:
//!
//!   * **Parallel to sync, not inside it.** The observer runs as an
//!     independent tokio task with its own lifecycle, matching the
//!     `startObservingMempool()` coroutine in
//!     zcash-android-wallet-sdk's `CompactBlockProcessor.kt`. This
//!     means the sync loop's progress isn't held up by mempool
//!     traffic, and the observer can keep running across sync
//!     iterations.
//!
//!   * **Dedicated lwd channel.** We never share the sync loop's
//!     gRPC client — long-running bidi streams don't play well with
//!     a channel that is simultaneously driving unary / server-
//!     streaming calls for compact blocks. Each reconnect opens a
//!     fresh channel via [`super::open_lwd_channel`], which also
//!     means we inherit the same TLS transport the scan loop uses.
//!
//!   * **Read-only DB access.** V1 of the observer does *not* call
//!     `decrypt_and_store_transaction`. It parses the raw bytes
//!     just far enough to get the txid, then checks whether that
//!     txid already exists in the wallet's `transactions` table
//!     with `mined_height IS NULL`. That is enough to power the
//!     "outbound tx just hit mempool" UX without racing against
//!     the sync loop's writes. A future v2 can re-add decryption
//!     for earlier discovery of *inbound* txs at the cost of
//!     handling SQLite write contention more carefully.
//!
//!   * **Reconnect semantics match the SDK.** lightwalletd closes
//!     the stream every time a new block is mined — normal EOF,
//!     not an error. We treat that as "sleep 1s, reconnect". Real
//!     errors use a 1s / 30s backoff ladder (first failure: 1s,
//!     subsequent consecutive failures: 30s), reset to zero on any
//!     successful connect. Cancel is checked inside the sleep so
//!     we don't block `stop_mempool_observer()` for 30s.
